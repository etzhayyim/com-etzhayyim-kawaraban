  "Phase G (com-junkawasaki/root, this session) -- wires kawaraban's EXISTING,
  already-verified building blocks into ONE runnable pipeline: RSS/Atom fetch
  (`methods/live_fetch.cljc`, UNCHANGED) -> G1/G3/G4/G8 charter gate
  (`methods/ingest.cljc`, UNCHANGED) -> per-outlet identity + CACAO
  signing + aozora XRPC publish, all via the kotoba-wasm componentization
  (`wasm/*.kotoba`, hosted through `kototama.tender`) Phase B/Phase F built
  and byte-exact-verified ONE MODULE AT A TIME. This namespace is the first
  thing that actually CALLS them as a single connected flow.

  `src/kawaraban/cacao.clj` / `src/kawaraban/aozora.clj` (the pre-existing
  pure-JVM path) are DELIBERATELY not required anywhere below -- replacing
  them with the wasm path is this phase's whole point, not a convenience
  shortcut back to the old implementation. The small amount of PURE
  payload-shaping logic every CACAO envelope still needs (SIWE-message text,
  resource-URI construction, did:key / canonical-graph derivation) is
  reimplemented below, kept deliberately in sync with `kawaraban.cacao`'s
  own copy by hand (small, stable, reviewed once here) -- NOT because it
  could move into wasm (wasm/README.md finding 6 already established
  did:key/graph-cid derivation needs bignum/base58/base32 encoding this
  language cannot express; it is host-side by hard necessity, not by
  choice, in every phase of this port).

  ============================================================================
  HONEST SCOPE -- three real findings this phase surfaced, read before
  assuming more than what is actually wired below:
  ============================================================================

  1. **cacao_self_mint.kotoba always mints a FRESH key -- it cannot sign
     with a PERSISTED one.** Its `main` unconditionally calls `gen-keypair`
     internally; there is no ABI to inject an existing seed. That is fine
     for Phase B's own proof (\"the fresh keygen+sign chain runs as real
     wasm\") but useless for THIS phase's actual need: kawaraban's per-outlet
     mirror identity must be minted ONCE and then reused (same did:key)
     across every subsequent run, exactly like `kawaraban.mirror-actor`'s
     existing `load-or-create-mirror-identity!` pattern. Closing this gap
     needed a genuinely NEW wasm module -- `wasm/identity_sign.kotoba`
     (this phase) -- whose only job is `(sign seed msg)` against a
     HOST-SUPPLIED seed (see that file's own header comment; it has no
     `gen-keypair` import at all, T3 capability confinement). Identity
     MINTING (first run for an outlet) still goes through
     `cacao_self_mint.wasm` (real Ed25519 keygen, wasm-hosted) -- only the
     keypair half of its output is kept; SIGNING on every subsequent run
     goes through the new `identity_sign.wasm` with that persisted seed.

  2. **wasm/aozora_create_record.kotoba's `record.*` sub-fields are
     digest-shaped, not kawaraban-article-shaped, and genuinely cannot be
     made to match without a language change.** That module's ABI
     (`record.analysis` / `record.cites.0.url` / `record.cites.1.url` /
     `record.createdAt` / `record.actor`) was built against
     cloud-itonami's `net.itonami.media.digest` record shape (a synthesized
     multi-article digest with citations), not kawaraban's own per-article
     `:news.article/*` mirror-record shape (`:news.article/headline` /
     `:news.article/excerpt` / `:news.article/url` / `:news.article/section`
     / `:news.article/outlet` / `:news.article/lang` / `:news.article/as-of`
     / `:news.article/sourcing`). Attempting a genuinely faithful port hits
     a real, NEW language-limitation finding (finding 7, `wasm/README.md`):
     `kototama.tender`'s dotted-path nesting convention
     (`build-nested-tree`, `(str/split k #\"\\.\")`) splits on EVERY literal
     '.' in a key -- but kawaraban's own field names (e.g.
     `\":news.article/id\"`) contain an embedded '.' as PART of the key
     itself (mirroring a namespaced-keyword's own dot), which collides
     with the SAME character the nesting convention uses as its ONLY
     structural separator. There is no escape mechanism for a literal dot
     inside a dotted-path segment today, so `{\"record\": {\":news.article/id\":
     ...}}` cannot be produced byte-faithfully via this convention without
     either widening kototama (out of scope this session) or renaming keys
     (a real wire-incompatibility, not attempted silently). Given that, this
     namespace REUSES `aozora_create_record.wasm` AS-IS with an explicit,
     documented field-mapping (see `create-record-via-wasm!`'s own
     docstring) rather than compiling a new, hand-offset-arithmetic'd module
     under this session's time/risk budget -- `repo`/`collection`/`rkey`/
     `actor` are semantically correct (real outlet DID, kawaraban's REAL
     collection, the article's own deterministic id); only
     `record.analysis`/`record.cites.*.url` are a deliberate repurpose
     (headline -> analysis, article url + outlet homepage -> the two
     citation slots). A dedicated `:news.article/*`-shaped module is a
     documented follow-up, not a silent gap.

  3. **The destination URL is baked into each network-calling wasm module
     as a `.kotoba` compile-time string literal, not a runtime parameter.**
     `.kotoba` has no runtime string construction (`str-ptr` only accepts a
     literal the compiler can see at compile time -- wasm/README.md
     finding 1), so `wasm/aozora_create_session.kotoba` /
     `wasm/aozora_create_record.kotoba` each hardcode
     `http://127.0.0.1/xrpc/...` in their own source -- there is no way for
     THIS orchestrator to point the already-compiled `.wasm` binaries at
     `https://pds.aozora.app` at runtime. \"Injectable http-fn\" therefore
     means something different here than in the old JVM path
     (`kawaraban.aozora/jvm-http-fn` was a literal function value threaded
     through opts): at the wasm layer, \"pointing at production\" is a
     RECOMPILE (swap the literal URL, rerun `wasm/README.md`'s own
     \"Rebuilding\" recipe) that produces a DIFFERENT `.wasm` file --
     this orchestrator's OWN injectability is at the file-path layer
     (`:wasm-dir` in every opts map below): swap in a directory containing
     production-URL-compiled `.wasm` binaries and every call site here
     picks them up unchanged, no code edit. This session deliberately does
     NOT compile or ship any such production-URL variant (that would be a
     real, callable, internet-reaching binary sitting in the repo even if
     never invoked THIS session -- a risk not worth taking against this
     task's hard \"no real network calls this session\" constraint). Making
     a production run possible is therefore a FUTURE, explicit compilation
     step for the repo owner, not something this phase silently prepares
     un-flagged.

     [Phase H, com-junkawasaki/root, 2026-07-23] That future step has now
     happened, deliberately and separately from this phase: both modules
     were recompiled with the real `https://pds.aozora.app` URL baked in
     (this repo's default `wasm/` directory now IS the production-URL
     variant; `:wasm-dir` injection above still works for anyone who wants
     to point at a DIFFERENT, e.g. loopback/test, build instead). The
     resulting real network reachability is gated by a SEPARATE, explicit
     opt-in (`KAWARABAN_WASM_PDS_ALLOWLIST`, see `pds-allowlist` below) --
     unset by default, so installing/running this orchestrator is still
     safe by default even against the now-real-URL binaries.
  ============================================================================

  Bounded by design (`:max-outlets` / `:max-articles-per-outlet`, both
  conservative by default): the 2026-07-10 first live-ingest activation at
  \"3 articles/outlet\" already pushed CPU past a safe budget once (see
  `run_live_ingest.clj`'s own addendum-2 note on shared-graph write
  pressure) -- this orchestrator defaults smaller still (1/outlet) since it
  is new, unproven code exercising a SEPARATE code path (wasm/Chicory
  instantiation per article, not just an HTTP POST) with its own unknown
  cost profile.

  High-water-mark (`data/ingest/last-seen-wasm.edn` by default --
  DELIBERATELY a different file from `run_live_ingest.clj`'s own
  `data/ingest/last-seen.edn`, since the two orchestrators mint DIFFERENT
  per-outlet identities -- see `identity-dir`'s own docstring -- and must
  not silently share or clobber each other's progress marks): same
  discipline as `run_live_ingest.clj` (mark advances to the max `as-of`
  among every GATE-PASSED/fetched record, regardless of publish outcome --
  a transient publish failure is retried next tick via the normal feed-
  window overlap, not by refusing to advance the mark)."
