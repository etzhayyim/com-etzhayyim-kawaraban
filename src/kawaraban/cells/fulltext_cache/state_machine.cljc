(ns kawaraban.cells.fulltext-cache.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for kawaraban 瓦版 fulltext_cache — the PRIVATE analysis
  buffer (ADR-2607010930, kawaraban G4 internal-buffer amendment).

  kawaraban is a MEDIUM: its PUBLIC article_mirror cell keeps G4 absolute —
  :news.article/full-text stays :db/allowed [false] / lexicon :const false, and a
  mirrored article projects headline + link + ≤280-char excerpt ONLY. That PUBLIC
  invariant is NOT weakened here.

  This cell is the charter-clean place kawaraban holds a fetched article BODY for
  an analysis consumer (yomi 読み, the news-intelligence SOURCE) — PRIVATELY. The
  body is cached in data/ingest/fulltext-buffer/ (gitignored), keyed by article_id
  with url/outlet/fetched-at provenance. It is NEVER transacted to the public
  Datom log, NEVER projected to a 面, NEVER published. article_mirror's fullText
  stays false in the public projection regardless of what is cached here.

  This is an 実装 (engineering) addition, NOT a G4 / Charter-Rider weakening: the
  public-facing copyright membrane (never publish / never represent full text in
  the public ontology) is unchanged; only an internal, non-public, analysis-only
  cache is added.

  Gate (access membrane, mirroring article_mirror's G4 access rule): a body is
  cached ONLY if the outlet is public-facing (:outlet/access ∈ {:open
  :registration-wall}). A paywall / proprietary-terminal body is REFUSED —
  kawaraban cannot have fetched it on the public-web-up contract in the first
  place. .solve() raises at R0 (live fetch is G8-gated = Council Lv6+ + operator)."
