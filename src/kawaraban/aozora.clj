  "Real app-aozora Publisher for kawaraban — creates a record in the
  com.etzhayyim.apps.kawaraban collection (RAD-recorded, kawaraban.identity.journal.edn tx 4)
  on an aozora PDS via the AT Protocol com.atproto.repo.createRecord XRPC, authenticated by a
  depth-1 self-minted CACAO (the actor's own did:key). 1:1 port of `tashikame.aozora`
  (ADR-2607110200) — see that namespace's docstring for the full design rationale.

  I/O is injected: an http-fn (default JDK java.net.http, no dependency) and a JSON pair
  passed by the caller, so this namespace stays dependency-free.

  Publication is kawaraban's own SPEECH (ADR-2606281500, autonomous-by-default) — bounded by
  the structural gates already enforced upstream (route/validate + cell state machines), NOT
  by a per-post operator/Council approval."

  `(HttpClient/newHttpClient)` with NO `.timeout(...)` on the request, unlike
  `kawaraban.methods.live-fetch/jvm-http-get`'s already-explicit 10s -- a single
  unresponsive createRecord/createSession call against the shared operator graph (which
  can legitimately take up to ~2 minutes under heavy novelty load, see that ADR's
  addendum 1) had no client-side ceiling at all, so a genuinely stuck request hung the
  whole batch indefinitely instead of failing loudly and letting the caller move on to
  the next outlet. 120s is comfortably above the worst observed real latency (~130s was
  the pre-fold extreme; steady state is single digits) while still bounded."
