(ns kawaraban.run-live-ingest
  "Non-interactive entrypoint that runs one live-ingest pass over every :verified outlet
  in `data/outlets/allowlist.edn`: fetch + normalize (src/kawaraban/methods/live_fetch.cljc, G1/G3/G4/G8
  gates unchanged) -> publish under that outlet's own per-outlet mirror identity
  (kawaraban.mirror-actor, G9 disclosure). Designed to be invoked periodically
  (clojure -M:live-ingest / GitHub Actions cron, ADR-2607110200 addendum 2) rather than
  only by hand.

  High-water-mark, NOT full-feed-republish every tick (ADR-2607110200 addendum 2, learned
  the hard way: a single one-outlet backfill run publishing 30 articles at once already
  pushed pds.aozora.app read latency on the shared operator graph from ~4s to ~50s, the
  same class of problem this ADR's addendum 1 fixed -- a naive 'republish everything the
  feed currently lists, every run' design would recreate that mass-write pressure on every
  single cron tick across 20 outlets, not just once). `last-seen-path` persists the max
  `:news.article/as-of` already published PER OUTLET; each run only publishes records
  strictly newer than that mark, so steady-state ticks touch a handful of genuinely-new
  articles instead of re-writing the whole visible feed window. The file is committed back
  to the repo by the calling workflow (NOT gitignored, NOT a secret -- unlike
  `.kawaraban/mirrors/*.edn`) so the mark survives across ephemeral CI runners. A fresh
  outlet (no prior mark) backfills its current feed window once, same as any first run.

  Publishing itself stays idempotent regardless (kawaraban.publish's :rkey is the
  article's own deterministic :news.article/id) -- the high-water-mark is purely a
  write-volume optimization, not a correctness requirement.

  KAWARABAN_ALLOW_LIVE_INGEST must be set for fetch-outlet! to do anything (G8); this
  script does not set it -- an operator/workflow env config does, same as any other run."
