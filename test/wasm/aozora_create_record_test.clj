  "Hosts wasm/aozora_create_record.wasm (compiled from
  wasm/aozora_create_record.kotoba, see wasm/README.md) via kototama.tender
  -- proves the confined slice of `kawaraban.aozora/create-record!` (build
  the real com.atproto.repo.createRecord request body via nested
  json-encode, POST it with BOTH required headers -- Content-Type AND
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt> -- via http-post-headers) runs as a real WASM
  guest, is BYTE-EXACT wire-compatible with the real JVM reference
  implementation, and that kototama's SSRF denylist still fires against
  this compiler-emitted guest exactly as it does for every other http-post*
  module in this port.

  This closes Phase B's wasm/README.md finding 5 (\"http-post/http-fetch
  take no header parameter at all\") for kawaraban's actual createRecord
  call, using `http-post-headers` (kotoba-lang/kototama PR #50,
  com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607231234 \"Phase E\") together with
  json-encode's dotted-path nesting (finding 4, same PR/ADR) -- Phase B's
  README explicitly said BOTH gaps needed to close before createRecord
  could be ported at all (\"A faithful port needs BOTH gaps closed
  first\"); this test proves they now are.

  [com-junkawasaki/root \"Phase H\", 2026-07-23] wasm/aozora_create_record.kotoba
  now targets the REAL https://pds.aozora.app (a deliberate, separate
  recompile from this loopback-only build -- see wasm/README.md), so
  kototama's SSRF denylist alone no longer refuses it. This session STILL
  makes NO real internet calls: `caps` below explicitly sets
  `:allowed-url-prefixes []` (kototama.contract/url-allowed?'s documented
  fail-closed \"empty collection = deny all\" semantics, NOT the `nil` =
  unrestricted default), so http-post-headers is GUARANTEED to return -1
  regardless of which real host the literal names."
